        <h2>Preoaration</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up.
            </li>
            <li>Pop a tea bag into your mug(<em>always</em> a big mug)</li>
            <li>Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly</li>
            <li>Tea needs time to unlock all its flavor, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.</li>
            <li>Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon agaionst the side of te mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.</li>
            <li>If you want, throw in some milk, or sugar, or honey... or nothing else at all.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
